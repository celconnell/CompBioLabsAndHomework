### Announced: Tuesday, 4/16/19

### Due: Friday, May 3rd, at 11:59 p.m.

### The goal of this assignment is to complete the project you outlined in [Assignment 08](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/Assignments/08_Independent_Project_Step1.md) in a fully reproducible way.
This means that I should be able to clone your repository, run your script(s), and get exactly the same results as you got with no error messages.

Completing Assignment 9 will require pushing a minimum of four files to an "Assignment09" directory in your Github repo for this class:

1. Any data file(s) you used (please let Sam know if you have any concerns about the size of the data or keeping them private),  
2. A script(s) of all the code you used to filter, parse, analyze, and visualize the data,  
3. A markdown document describing what you did (see "[suggested format and organization](#ExampleLayout)", below), and  
4. An image file(s) that is a visualization(s) of the results produced by your script.

The data file(s) should be the raw data as you obtained them.  The script should include the parsing/formatting of the raw data AND the steps you took with those data to arrive at your results.  The markdown document should explain it all (see "[suggested format and organization](#ExampleLayout)", below).

Your grade on Assignment 9 will be out of a total of 37 available points.  The breakdown of these points will be as follows:  

* All required files are present: 1 point (but see note above about large and/or private data)
* Your script(s) achieves its goals and works perfectly when I run it: 15 points
* Your markdown document is well written and complete: 10 points
* There is at least one visualization (figure/graph) produced by the script, and the markdown document includes the visualization(s) and an appropriate explanation of it: 3 points
* The visualization(s) produced by the script is exactly the same as what appears in the markdown document: 1 point
* Your script is well commented so I understand what it does: 2 points
* Your materials are all appropriately named and appear in a sensible directory in your repo.  For example, a directory in your repo could be named "Final_Project", and the markdown doc  in that directory could be named "README.md": 1 point
* A subjective evaluation of the difficulty of your challenge and the elegance, ingenuity, and creativity displayed by your code: 4 points


* You must also properly **cite references, of course!!**  See [this guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html).

# Your Title

### Biological question
This question should be stated as a question that can be understood independently of knowing about the specific dataset that is being used to address it.

### Context (introduction)
This should help a naive reader make sense of what to expect and why it is interesting. It should make sense even before the reader reads the Methods. 

### Methods
##### The source of the data:
Describe the data you used to study your question and its origins.  (Give FULL citations with working hyperlinks for the original publication AND the data package, if applicable).

Give a description (one or two paragraphs) of how the data were produced.

Give a description of the size and nature of the data.  Feel free to comment on any special challenges presented by any aspect of the data.

##### What the original authors did with the data:
Give about 1 - 2 paragraphs of explanation.

##### What _YOU_ did with the data and how you did it:
Verbally describe what your approach was and how you achieved it.  You don't need to include code here; rather, the goal is to give the reader an idea of what your code does and why and how it does it.  Don't give the results here, though.  Throughout this section, strive to be crystal clear about which things the original authors did and which things you did.  Saying "this study" is ambiguous in that regard, so make it clear.

### Results and conclusions
What did you find?  How does this relate to your question?  Include at least one visualization.
