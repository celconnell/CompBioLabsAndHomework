# How could you, perhaps in multiple commands, make a new data file that had
#   (i) only columns 2-4,
#   (ii) the header row, and 
#   (iii) only the last 10 lines of data?
# In other words, what commands could you issue to create a new .csv file
# with 11 lines of data total and three columns total,
# in which the top line should be the original headers, 
# and the other 10 lines should be the last 10 lines of the original data?
