# Lab 8: Documentation and Metadata

CONNELL_Lab8. R is a script that contains a logistic growth function, `logisticGrowth`. 

## To run:

```logisticGrowth(r, K, numGens, startingPopSize)```

##### Arguments:

`r` = intrinsic growth rate
`K`= carrying capacity
`numGens` = the total number of generations
`startingPopSize` = initial population size



This script also writes the data collected from the function into a .csv file. My example output can be found [here](logisticGrowthData.csv).



## Example:

###### example input:

```logisticGrowth(0.6,100,20,5)```



###### example output:
